# git_terminal
# search github by search term through your termiinal
This script prompts the user to enter their Github username and password (or an access token) to authenticate, and then prompts the user to enter a search query. It uses the search_repositories function provided by the PyGithub library to search for repositories matching the query, and then prints the details of each repository returned by the search.

It's important to note that you will need to have the PyGithub library installed in your environment to use this script. You can install it by running pip install PyGithub.
